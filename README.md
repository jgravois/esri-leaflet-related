# Esri Leaflet Related Records

Esri Leaflet Related Records is a small API helper to assist querying related tables published in ArcGIS Server or ArcGIS Online. It relies on the minimal Esri Leaflet Core which handles abstraction for requests and authentication when necessary. You can find out more about the Esri Leaflet Core [here](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/).

## Example
Note that the latest version of this plugin requires changes introduced in esri-leaflet 2.0.0-beta.6.

Take a look at [this sample](https://jgravois.github.io/esri-leaflet-related/index.html) to see it in action.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=utf-8 />
  <title>related table</title>
  <meta name='viewport' content='initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no' />

    #map {
      position: absolute;

    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="map"></div>

<script>
  var map = L.map('map').setView([34.059, -117.203], 14);
  L.esri.basemapLayer('Topographic').addTo(map);

  var fl = L.esri.featureLayer({
    url: '//services.arcgis.com/uCXeTVveQzP4IIcx/ArcGIS/rest/services/stationActivity/FeatureServer/0'
  }).addTo(map);

  var query = L.esri.Related.query(fl);

  //wire up event listener to fire query when users click on a feature
  fl.on("click", queryRelated);

  function queryRelated (evt) {
    query.objectIds([evt.layer.feature.id]).relationshipId("0").run(function(error, response, raw) {
        var currentFeature = fl.getFeature(evt.layer.feature.id);
        currentFeature.bindPopup('matching rows: ' + response.features.length);
        currentFeature.openPopup();
    })
  }

</script>

## API Reference

### [`L.esri.Related.Query`](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/api-reference/tasks/query-related.html)

## Development Instructions

1. [Fork and clone Esri Leaflet Related](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet-related` folder and install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` from the command line. This will compile minified source in a brand new `dist` directory, launch a tiny webserver and begin watching the raw source for changes.
4. The example at `debug/sample.html` *should* 'just work'
5. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

## Dependencies

Esri Leaflet Related Records relies on the minimal Esri Leaflet Core which handles abstraction for requests and authentication when neccessary. You can fine out more about teh Esri Leaflet Core on the [Esri Leaflet downloads page](http://esri.github.com/esri-leaflet/downloads).
